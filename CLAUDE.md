# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Box-Agent is a minimal yet professional AI agent framework supporting multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, DeepSeek, SiliconFlow, and any third-party API). It features interleaved thinking, tool calling, MCP support, and a Claude Skills system.

## Architecture

**Execution core** (`core.py`): `run_agent_loop()` is the single source of truth for the agent loop. It is an `AsyncGenerator[AgentEvent, None]` that yields structured events (`StepStart`, `ThinkingEvent`, `ContentEvent`, `ToolCallStart`, `ToolCallResult`, `DoneEvent`, `ArtifactEvent`, etc.) defined in `events.py`. No `print()` or `input()` calls — all I/O is delegated to consumers. Two-layer context compression: Layer 1 micro-compact (zero-cost, replaces old tool results with placeholders every step) + Layer 2 token-aware summarization (LLM summary at 80k threshold). Cancellation support and universal artifact detection (regex-based + workspace diff-based).

**Agent** (`agent.py`): Public API wrapper. `Agent.run_events()` returns the raw event stream; `Agent.run()` is a backward-compatible method that consumes events and renders them to the terminal via `_render_event()`.

**ACP bridge** (`acp/`): Consumes `run_agent_loop()` events and translates them to ACP protocol updates (`sessionUpdate`). Streaming deltas (thinking/content) are forwarded in real-time — each delta triggers an immediate `update_agent_thought`/`update_agent_message` send (no accumulation). Supports `session_mode` via ACP `_meta` (currently only `data_analysis`); when omitted, `intent_classifier.py` auto-classifies on the first prompt (see "Session mode" below). Mode-specific system prompts are injected via `_build_session_prompt()` using a `_MODE_PROMPT_MAP` dict. Automatically inherits summarization, logging, and safety from the shared core.

**LLM layer** (`llm/`): Multi-provider via `LLMClient` wrapper. `AnthropicClient` handles Anthropic-protocol APIs; `OpenAIClient` handles OpenAI-protocol APIs. Both implement `LLMClientBase`. The `api_base` is used as-is (no automatic URL suffix), so any third-party endpoint works directly. Both clients accept a session-level `thinking_enabled` kwarg: Anthropic sends `thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 8000}`; Providers that don't recognize the fields silently ignore them.

**Tool system** (`tools/`): Abstract `Tool` base class with `to_schema()` (Anthropic format), `to_openai_schema()`, and `parallel_safe` attribute. `EventEmittingTool(Tool)` adds real-time progress event emission via `asyncio.Queue` — used by `SubAgentTool`. Built-in tools: `ReadTool`, `WriteTool`, `EditTool`, `BashTool`, `BashOutputTool`, `BashKillTool`, `TodoWriteTool`, `TodoReadTool`, `SubAgentTool`, `MemoryWriteTool`, `MemoryReadTool`, `MemorySearchTool`. MCP tools loaded via `mcp_loader.py`. Skills loaded from `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter via `skill_loader.py`.

**Memory system** (`memory.py`): Dual-file architecture — `MEMORY.md` (core: user identity/preferences, always injected into system prompt) + `CONTEXT.md` (searchable: project context/task patterns, retrieved on demand via `memory_search` tool). `MemoryExtractor` runs as background `asyncio.create_task` at three lifecycle points: before context compression, every N steps, and at agent loop end (`DoneEvent`). Writes only to CONTEXT.md with line-level exact-match merges. One-time LLM-filtered import from `~/.openclaw/` (USER.md + MEMORY.md) into core on first startup. `append_context()` enforces code-level dedup against core — lines already in MEMORY.md are automatically filtered. Config: `enable_memory_extraction`, `memory_extraction_cooldown`, `memory_extraction_step_interval`. Per-session `MemoryExtractor` instances in ACP to avoid cross-session state leaks.

**Sandbox** (`tools/jupyter_tool.py`): Dual-mode execution environment. In normal mode: subprocess kernel in isolated venv (`SandboxEnvironment` + `JupyterKernelSession`). In frozen/runtime mode: in-process kernel (`InProcessKernelSession` via `ipykernel.inprocess`) with bundled packages. `IS_FROZEN` flag (from `sys.frozen`) selects the mode. Runtime package installs go to `~/.box-agent/runtime-packages/` via pip-as-library, gated by `ALLOWED_RUNTIME_PACKAGES` whitelist. Structured error codes: `SANDBOX_INIT_FAILED`, `KERNEL_START_FAILED`, `KERNEL_DIED`, `PACKAGE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `PACKAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE`. All kernel `execute()` calls run in `run_in_executor` + `asyncio.wait_for` to avoid blocking the event loop; pip install operations have a 120s timeout.

**Safety layer** (`tools/safety.py`): Dangerous command detection (rm, sudo, kill, etc.) with user confirmation prompt (supports Chinese). Workspace path validation blocks access outside workspace when `allow_full_access: false`. Auto-backup to `~/.box-agent/trash/{timestamp}/` before file modifications. Non-interactive mode (`--task`) rejects dangerous commands outright.

**Config** (`config.py`): Pydantic models. Load priority: `box_agent/config/` (dev) → `~/.box-agent/config/` (installed) → package directory (fallback). Main files: `config.yaml`, `system_prompt.md`, `analysis_prompt.md`, `mcp.json`.

**CLI** (`cli.py`): Interactive mode with prompt_toolkit. In-session commands: `/help`, `/clear`, `/history`, `/stats`, `/log`, `/exit`. Subcommands: `setup`, `config`, `doctor`, `log`. Auto-launches setup wizard on first run or when API connection fails.

## Key Patterns

- All LLM and tool calls are async
- Retry with exponential backoff (`retry.py`, `@async_retry` decorator)
- Tools return `ToolResult` (Pydantic model with success/content/error)
- Skills use progressive disclosure: YAML metadata loaded first, full content on-demand
- Agent workspace defaults to CWD; logs go to `~/.box-agent/log/`
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest config — async tests work without markers
- Safety: dangerous commands require confirmation; workspace scope enforced by default; files auto-backed up before modification
- Permission negotiation: in-band blocking flow for out-of-workspace access. `GrantStore` tracks grants at prompt/session scope; `PermissionEngine` consults grant store before policy check. `run_agent_loop()` accepts `permission_negotiator` — on tool denial with `permission_request`, negotiator is called and tool retried on grant. CLI uses interactive terminal prompt (`cli_permissions.py`, `termios`+`run_in_executor`); ACP uses `session/request_permission` reverse RPC (`_PermissionNegotiator` in `acp/__init__.py`, 120s timeout). `officev3_permissions_override` in `session/new._meta` is deprecated (parsed but ignored)
- Artifact pipeline: every artifact lands under `{workspace}/output/` — the sandbox kernel chdirs there, `write_file` resolves `output/<name>` relative paths there, and the host's file panel only trusts this directory. Detection is two-layer: regex scans tool output for `[filename.ext]` references that resolve under `output/`, workspace diff catches files created by any tool. Both emit a single `ArtifactEvent` (kind/filename/rel_path/abs_path/uri/mime/size/sha256/produced_at). ACP serializes via `_artifact_envelope()` with stable `type: "artifact"` discriminator on `tool_call_update.rawOutput`. Helpers in `core.py`: `ensure_output_dir()`, `safe_output_name()`, `avoid_collision()`, `_make_artifact()`
- LibreOffice (`soffice`) is a system dependency, NOT auto-installed. Excel export defaults to pandas + openpyxl. `recalc.py` gracefully handles missing soffice
- Browser automation (Playwright MCP): `@playwright/mcp` is registered in `mcp-example.json` as `playwright`, `disabled: true` by default. Chromium cache defaults to `~/.box-agent/browsers/` (shared by CLI install and ACP runtime). `box-agent install-browser` runs `playwright install chromium` with `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` pinned to this path, then flips `disabled` to `false` in `~/.box-agent/config/mcp.json`. `run_acp_server()` calls `os.environ.setdefault("PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH", "~/.box-agent/browsers")` at startup — hosts that want a different cache export the env var before spawning `box-agent-acp`. If Chromium is absent, Playwright MCP tool calls fail with its own error; we don't wrap. `doctor` reports runtime status
- Frozen/runtime mode: `IS_FROZEN` flag selects in-process kernel, skips venv creation, routes package installs through whitelist + `~/.box-agent/runtime-packages/`
- Sub-agent: `SubAgentTool` runs tasks in isolated message contexts via `run_agent_loop()`. Child tools exclude `sub_agent` itself (no recursion). Multiple sub-agents execute in parallel via `asyncio.gather` (tools with `parallel_safe = True`)
- EventEmittingTool: base class for tools that emit real-time progress events via an `asyncio.Queue` that core.py drains in the foreground generator. Both sequential and parallel execution blocks support this pattern. SubAgentTool emits `SubAgentEvent` directly.
- PPT support: Provided entirely through the `ppt` skill (loaded from `SKILL.md` via `skill_loader.py`). The agent invokes general-purpose tools; there are no dedicated PPT modes/tools/prompts in box-agent core.
- Context compression: Layer 1 `_micro_compact()` runs every step, replaces tool results older than last 3 with `[Previous result from {tool}: {first_line}...]` (token-aware: keep window shrinks if recent results themselves blow the budget). Layer 2 `_maybe_summarize()` triggers an LLM summary when estimated tokens exceed `context_token_limit` (derived as `0.9 × (context_window − max_output_tokens)`; with defaults 180000/80000 ≈ 90k). Logger captures originals — no data loss. Full design: `docs/CONTEXT_COMPRESSION.md` (中文版 `docs/CONTEXT_COMPRESSION_CN.md`)
- Memory: dual-file `MEMORY.md` (core, always injected) + `CONTEXT.md` (searchable on demand). Two write paths — skill-guided LLM calls `memory_write` for explicit user intent, `MemoryExtractor` auto-extracts to CONTEXT.md in background (`asyncio.create_task`). Core/Context dedup enforced at code level (`append_context()` filters lines present in core). OpenClaw import is one-time LLM-filtered bootstrap into core
- Memory maintenance: `MemoryMaintainer` (memory_maintainer.py) runs at CLI/ACP startup, guarded by `.maintainer_last_run` (24h interval). Three phases on `CONTEXT.md` — decay (hits=0 + last_used > `memory_decay_days` → `CONTEXT.archive.md`), cleanup (archive > decay+`memory_archive_days` → `~/.box-agent/memory/trash/<date>/`), dedup (greedy Jaccard at `memory_dedup_jaccard`, winner = higher hits / older created; metadata merged). `ContextEntry` carries HTML-comment header metadata (id/created/last_used/hits/source/confidence + optional core_status/last_proposed); legacy line-based CONTEXT.md auto-migrates on first write
- Memory promotion gate: `run_agent_loop` emits `MemoryProposalEvent` before terminal `DoneEvent` when `memory_promotion_proposal_enabled` and there are entries with `hits >= memory_promotion_hit_threshold`, not rejected, not in cooldown. `consume_core_proposal({id: pin/skip/reject})` — pin moves entry to MEMORY.md (line-dedup), reject sets `core_status="rejected"` (permanent, never re-proposed), skip is no-op (cooldown bumped at emit). CLI: termios prompts via `CLIMemoryProposalNegotiator` + `/memory review` slash command (bypasses cooldown). ACP: `_MemoryProposalNegotiator` calls `extMethod("session/memory_proposal", payload)` with 120s timeout; host opt-in via `_session/memory_proposal` JSON-RPC, returns `{decisions: {id: "pin"|"skip"|"reject"}}`; method_not_found degrades to skip-all
- ACP stdout guard: `sys.stdout = sys.stderr` in ACP mode (must use direct assignment, NOT `TextIOWrapper(sys.stderr.buffer)` which destroys stderr on GC). `_real_stdout = sys.__stdout__` (not `sys.stdout`, which may be pre-guarded by `runtime_entry.py`). Real stdout restored only for the stdio transport setup, then re-guarded. All diagnostics and third-party output go to stderr
- ACP stdin buffer ceiling: do NOT call upstream `acp.stdio_streams()` — it builds `asyncio.StreamReader()` without a `limit`, defaulting to 64 KiB. A single inbound JSON-RPC frame larger than that (e.g. `session/prompt` with base64-inlined images, a large pasted document, or host-injected `_meta`) raises `asyncio.LimitOverrunError` inside `Connection._receive_loop`; the loop's `except` only catches `CancelledError`, so it dies silently and every later RPC future is rejected with `ConnectionError("Connection closed")` — the symptom on the host side. Use `box_agent.acp.stdio_compat.stdio_streams_largebuf()` instead, which replicates the upstream POSIX/Windows stdio helpers verbatim and passes `limit=4 * 1024 * 1024` (4 MiB) to the reader. Everything else in `acp` (Connection, AgentSideConnection, dispatcher, schemas) is still used unchanged. If the 4 MiB ceiling ever bites, raise `_READ_LIMIT` in `stdio_compat.py` — do not switch back to the upstream helper
- Session mode auto-classification: when ACP caller omits `_meta.session_mode` on `session/new`, `SessionState.auto_classify_pending=True`. On the first `prompt`, `intent_classifier.classify_session_mode()` runs a single tool-free LLM call (8s timeout, whitelist-validated, failure → `None`/general). `_apply_session_mode(state, mode)` then retroactively rewrites `messages[0]` preserving the workspace-info footer, and re-applies the cached `memory_block`. Explicit `session_mode` skips classification entirely
- Deep-think / extended thinking: session-level toggle via `_meta.deep_think: bool` on `session/new`. Threaded as `thinking_enabled` through `Agent.__init__` → `run_agent_loop` → `LLMClient.generate_stream`. Anthropic path: `thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 8000}` (only `enabled`/`disabled` are valid; no `adaptive`). Budget is hardcoded 8000 tokens. Classifier and summary LLM calls always run with `thinking_enabled=False`. Caveat: some models (e.g. MiniMax M2 series) emit thinking blocks unconditionally as part of their default output; the toggle is honored by the wire protocol but cannot suppress provider-side reasoning behavior
- Cancellation: cooperative — `is_cancelled` callback is checked at five points: top of each step, between LLM stream chunks, after stream completes, before tools, and after each tool. CLI installs a key listener that flips a flag on Esc; ACP flips `state.cancelled` from `cancel()` notification. Mid-stream cancellation breaks the chunk loop and yields `DoneEvent(stop_reason=CANCELLED)` immediately rather than waiting for the LLM to finish
- CLI input: simple Esc-to-cancel listener while the agent runs (`termios` cbreak in a daemon thread, no scroll-region UI). The `inject_queue` plumbing in `run_agent_loop` is preserved for ACP only — ACP exposes `_inject` extension method (turn-active guarded, stale queue drained per turn). CLI does not currently wire up inject
- Lightweight LLM endpoint: ACP extension method `_llm/prompt` for title/summary/classification-style one-shot calls. Bypasses `newSession` entirely — no session, no tools, no skills, no MCP wait, no memory recall/extraction, no conversation history. Backed by `box_agent/llm/lightweight.py::run_lightweight_prompt(llm, prompt, system_prompt=None, timeout=30.0)` which wraps `LLMClient.generate(tools=None, thinking_enabled=False)` in `asyncio.wait_for`. Request: `{prompt, systemPrompt?, timeoutMs?, workspaceLabel?, _meta?: {purpose?}}`. Success: `{text, finishReason, usage:{inputTokens,outputTokens}, durationMs}`. Failure: `{error:{code,message}}` with codes `invalid_args` / `timeout` / `lightweight_failed`. Logs purpose/duration/token counts but never the prompt body
- Per-turn token total: `box_agent/llm/token_meter.py` is a context-local accumulator. `LLMClient.generate`/`generate_stream` (the single choke point all LLM calls funnel through — main multi-step loop, Layer-2 summarization, background `MemoryExtractor`) call `record_usage(usage)`. ACP `_prompt` wraps `_run_turn` with `start_token_meter()`/`reset_token_meter()` and returns the turn total on `PromptResponse._meta.usage.totalTokens` (host-side telemetry; officev3 埋点 reads it). Per-turn scoped (resets each turn, not cumulative). `asyncio.create_task` children copy the context and mutate the same accumulator, so in-turn memory extraction is counted — but fire-and-forget extractions (notably `loop_end`) that finish after the turn returns are NOT reflected (best-effort for memory, exact for main loop + summarization). The `_llm/prompt` lightweight endpoint runs outside any turn, so no meter is active there (no double counting). Tests: `tests/test_token_meter.py`, `tests/test_acp.py::test_acp_prompt_response_reports_turn_token_total`

## Configuration

Run `box-agent setup` for interactive configuration, or manually copy `box_agent/config/config-example.yaml` to `box_agent/config/config.yaml`. Provider field (`anthropic` or `openai`) determines which client is used. The `api_base` is passed through directly — supports any compatible endpoint.

## Publishing

```bash
# Bump version in pyproject.toml and box_agent/__init__.py
# Regenerate the builtin skills whitelist so orphan SKILL.md files left
# behind by downstream installers (e.g. officev3) are filtered out at runtime.
python scripts/generate_skills_manifest.py  # writes box_agent/skills/_manifest.json
uv build
uvx twine upload dist/box_agent-<version>*
gh release create v<version> dist/box_agent-<version>* --repo Raccoon-Office/Box-Agent --title "v<version>"
```

### Standalone Runtime Build

```bash
# Build PyInstaller binary for current platform
uv run python scripts/build_runtime.py
# Output: dist/runtime/box-agent-runtime-v{version}-{platform}-{arch}.tar.gz

# Upload runtime artifact to the same GitHub Release
gh release upload v<version> dist/runtime/box-agent-runtime-*.tar.gz --repo Raccoon-Office/Box-Agent
```

Runtime structure: `box-agent-runtime/{manifest.json, VERSION, bin/box-agent-acp, runtimes/node}` on macOS. The binary communicates via ACP JSON-RPC over stdio. Hard constraint: stdout = pure ACP protocol, all diagnostics go to stderr.

Key files:

- `scripts/build_runtime.py` — PyInstaller build script, auto-detects platform
- `box_agent/acp/runtime_entry.py` — Clean entry point for standalone binary
- `box_agent/acp/debug_logger.py` — Structured logger (stderr + optional file, env-var controlled)
