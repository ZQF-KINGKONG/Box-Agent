"""Lightweight LLM completion service.

Single-shot prompts (titles, summaries, rewrites) that must
NOT spin up an Agent session, load tools/skills/MCP, touch memory, or write
to conversation history. Wraps :func:`LLMClient.generate` with a hard
timeout, no tools, no extended thinking, and a structured result.

The ACP ``llm/prompt`` extension method is a thin shell around this
service — see :meth:`box_agent.acp.BoxACPAgent.extMethod`.
