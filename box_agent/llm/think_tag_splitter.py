"""Unwrap inline `<think>...</think>` blocks from LLM text output.

Some providers (notably MiniMax M2.x and several GLM/Qwen variants) embed
chain-of-thought directly in the text/content stream as `<think>...</think>`
instead of using a dedicated `thinking` channel. Box-Agent treats those text
deltas as user-facing content, so the front-end never receives
`agent_thought_chunk` events and the raw tags pollute the rendered Markdown.

This module provides a streaming state machine and a non-streaming helper that
relocate the tagged regions back to the `thinking` field, leaving the visible
content clean. It is a no-op for providers that already use the standard
thinking channel — `<think>` simply never appears in their text deltas.
