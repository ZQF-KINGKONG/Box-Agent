"""Per-turn token accounting via a context-local accumulator.

Every LLM call in the system funnels through :class:`LLMClient`
(``generate`` / ``generate_stream``) — the main multi-step loop, the
Layer-2 summarization call, and the background ``MemoryExtractor``.  By
recording usage at that single choke point into a context-local
accumulator, a consumer can scope one accumulator per turn and read the
combined total when the turn ends.

Scoping model
-------------
``start_token_meter()`` installs a fresh :class:`TokenAccumulator` into a
:class:`~contextvars.ContextVar` and returns its reset token.  Anything
that runs within that context — including ``asyncio.create_task`` children,
which copy the context and therefore observe the *same* accumulator object
— adds to it via :func:`record_usage`.  ``reset_token_meter()`` restores the
previous accumulator; it does not destroy the object, so a late background
task that finishes after reset still mutates the (now-detached) accumulator
harmlessly.

Caveat: the background ``MemoryExtractor`` is fire-and-forget.  Extractions
that have not completed by the time the consumer reads the total (notably
the ``loop_end`` extraction) are not yet reflected — the count is
best-effort for memory, exact for the synchronous main loop and
summarization calls.
