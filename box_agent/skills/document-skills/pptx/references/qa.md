# PPTX QA Reference

Use this checklist after creating or editing a `.pptx`.

## Required Checks

Keep every temporary report, helper script, extracted text file, and rendered
image inside the current workspace or requested output folder. Do not write to
`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, or another absolute temp path.

For HTML-first decks exported with `scripts/html_to_editable_pptx.js` and
`dom-to-pptx`, inspect both the source HTML preview PNGs and the rendered PPTX
when renderer runtime exists. If rendering is blocked (missing `soffice`/PDF
renderer), continue with the rest of QA and report render as blocked.

Editable export can reflow text, shift layers, or lose CSS effects, so source
previews alone are not enough.

0. HTML self-check for HTML-first decks:
   - Run `${BOX_AGENT_NODE:-node} scripts/html_self_check.js deck.html --dom-to-pptx --allow-local-images --report qa/html_self_check.json` before export, or rely on `scripts/html_to_editable_pptx.js` which writes the same check internally.
   - Always use the stricter `--dom-to-pptx` compatibility profile for new HTML-first decks.
   - Confirm every `.slide` reports exactly `1920x1080` unless the user explicitly requested a nonstandard output size.
   - Confirm `qa/html_self_check.json` exists, is non-empty, and has `"ok": true`. If it is missing, report HTML self-check as `BLOCKED`.
   - Fix failures before export. This catches DOM/CSS layout bugs such as progress `.fill` elements left as `display:inline`, zero-size bars/charts, text overflow, missing images, and content outside the slide.
   - If the command exits non-zero, inspect the report file before concluding the error has no detail. Summarize concrete failures and fix the HTML; route-change and bypass rules live in `SKILL.md`.
   - This is a preflight gate, not visual QA. Passing it does not mean the slide looks good.

1. Package validation:
   - Run `${BOX_AGENT_PYTHON:-python3} scripts/validate_pptx_package.py output.pptx`.
   - Fix zip, relationship, missing part, or invalid XML errors before delivery.

2. Text extraction:
   - Run `${BOX_AGENT_PYTHON:-python3} scripts/extract_text.py output.pptx`.
   - Verify slide count, slide order, expected titles, and requested content.
   - Verify visible page numbers against actual slide order. Use a consistent
     `NN / TOTAL` style such as `03 / 08`; non-cover slides should not silently
     omit folios. A cover may omit the page number only when the deck uses that
     convention intentionally and the next slide starts at `02 / TOTAL`.

3. Placeholder scan:
   - Check for `lorem`, `ipsum`, `todo`, `placeholder`, `xxxx`, and template instructions.
   - Treat hits in notes, masters, and layouts as warnings unless the user asked to edit them.
   - Reject empty or failed QA files. A 0-byte JSON/TXT/MD report is not a pass;
     rerun the check, replace it with a real report, or mark that check `BLOCKED`.

4. Render:
   - Run `${BOX_AGENT_PYTHON:-python3} scripts/render_pptx.py output.pptx --out rendered`.
   - Do not pre-check `soffice` and skip this command. The render script owns renderer discovery, Quick Look fallback, and missing-LibreOffice messaging.
   - If this command fails due to dependency/runtime missing, treat render as blocked and continue: `Rendering: BLOCKED`.
   - If rendering is blocked by permissions or missing runtime after the deck changed, previous render images are stale. Do not use old renders as final proof for the new deck.
   - Do not pass `--format png` unless a PNG is explicitly required; the default JPG output is intentionally compressed to reduce file size.
   - The preferred path is `soffice` PPTX-to-PDF plus `pdftoppm` PDF-to-PNG.
   - If Poppler is unavailable, the script may use Node pdf.js with `pdfjs-dist` and `@napi-rs/canvas`.
   - On macOS, Quick Look is only a lightweight fallback.

## Blocked Rendering

If no per-slide image or preview is produced, report:

```text
Rendering: BLOCKED
Reason: missing soffice, missing PDF renderer, or conversion failure
```

Still report package validation, text extraction, and placeholder scan results.
Do not say "OOXML checks ensure quality" or "rendering is complete" when
`render_pptx.py` was not run. OOXML checks are structural checks only.
If `soffice` is missing, tell the user that LibreOffice is required for
PPTX-to-PDF conversion and provide this official download page:
`https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/`.
Do not imply that Node pdf.js can replace LibreOffice; Node pdf.js only handles
PDF-to-PNG after a PDF already exists.
This requirement also applies when macOS Quick Look succeeds, because Quick
Look is only a lightweight fallback and does not provide full per-slide QA.
On Windows/Linux, Quick Look is not available for this role. If `soffice` is
missing, emit `Rendering: BLOCKED`.

## Office Raccoon Command Safety

The permission engine may block common shell habits. Avoid them.

- Do not write QA logs to `/tmp`, `/dev/null`, `/var/tmp`, or absolute output paths.
- Do not use shell redirects for QA output. The permission engine can block
  redirects before it proves whether the path is safe, especially for absolute
  paths. Instead, run helpers that write files directly or pass explicit output
  arguments such as `--out rendered`.
- Do not use inline heredocs such as `python3 - <<'PY'`.
- Do not chain a long command that mixes `unzip`, `cat`, `tail`, and inline Python.
- Do not call Node `execFileSync()` with a full shell command string such as
  `execFileSync("unzip -l deck.pptx")`; Node treats the whole string as the
  executable name. Use `execFileSync("unzip", ["-l", "deck.pptx"])` or the
  provided Python helper scripts.
- Do not manually probe Quick Look with `qlmanage -h >/dev/null`; run
  `scripts/render_pptx.py` and let it decide whether Quick Look is available.
- Prefer the provided helper scripts. If custom logic is needed, create a short
  `.py` or `.js` helper file inside the workspace, run it, and let that helper
  write outputs to paths such as `qa/package_check.txt`,
  `qa/text_extract.txt`, or `rendered/`.

For package tests, prefer Python `zipfile` or Node zip readers over extracting
the deck to a temporary directory.

## Deliverable Package Hygiene

Before final handoff, inspect the output folder.

- Remove `.DS_Store`, editor caches, temporary scratch scripts, failed downloads,
  and unreferenced intermediate files.
- Remove or replace empty QA artifacts such as 0-byte `.json`, `.txt`, or `.md`
  files.
- Keep the final deck, source file(s), and rendered previews.
- Do not create a ZIP archive unless the user asked for one. Normal delivery
  should list the `.pptx`, source file(s), and speaker notes paths.

## Reporting Format

Use short sections. Put each result on its own line and leave a blank line
between progress blocks; do not concatenate all QA steps into one paragraph.

1. `Created`: output `.pptx` path.
2. `Source`: generator script and asset paths.
3. `QA`: package validation, text extraction, placeholder scan, rendering.
4. `Fixes`: issues found and corrected.
5. `Limitations`: blocked renderers, Quick Look-only checks, missing fonts, or unsupported objects.
