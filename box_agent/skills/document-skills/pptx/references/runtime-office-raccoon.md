# Runtime for Office Raccoon

## 1. Path and variables

1. Read runtime variables with priority: `$BOX_AGENT_NODE`, `$BOX_AGENT_NPM`, `$BOX_AGENT_PYTHON`, `$BOX_AGENT_RUNTIME_PREFIX`, `$BOX_AGENT_RENDER_RUNTIME`, `$BOX_AGENT_SOFFICE`, `$BOX_AGENT_PDFTOPPM`.
2. Use local defaults when a variable is not set.

## 2. Export runtime rules

1. Prefer editable flow with `scripts/html_to_editable_pptx.js` for new decks.
2. Do not use npm `dom-to-pptx`; export only through bundled `scripts/dom-to-pptx.bundle.js`.
3. For preflight checks use `scripts/check_html_export_env.js` before full deck authoring when final PPTX is expected.
4. If no host renderer exists, stop route selection and ask user to choose `HTML` or `PPTX`.
5. When browser export is blocked and user chooses `PPTX`, switch to `PptxGenJS`.

## 3. Dependency install path

1. Install Node dependencies only into managed Office Raccoon prefixes.
2. Example install command: `${BOX_AGENT_NPM:-npm} install --prefix "$HOME/Library/Application Support/office-raccoon" pptxgenjs`
3. For Playwright setup:

```bash
OFFICE_RACCOON_NODE_PREFIX="${BOX_AGENT_NODE_PREFIX:-${BOX_AGENT_RUNTIME_PREFIX:-$HOME/Library/Application Support/office-raccoon}}"
${BOX_AGENT_NPM:-npm} install --prefix "$OFFICE_RACCOON_NODE_PREFIX" playwright
"$OFFICE_RACCOON_NODE_PREFIX/node_modules/.bin/playwright" install chromium
```

4. For OpenAI runtime install in this skill path, use managed install path and `--prefix`.

## 4. Render path

1. Use `scripts/render_pptx.py` for visual QA.
2. Use `BOX_AGENT_RENDER_RUNTIME`, `BOX_AGENT_SOFFICE`, and `BOX_AGENT_PDFTOPPM` when present.
3. Never claim "rendering done" without produced slide images or per-slide preview files.
4. If render is unavailable, report `render: BLOCKED` and keep previous steps marked as stale if deck changed after checks.

## 5. Workspace boundary

1. Keep temporary logs, previews, generated images, QA outputs in workspace/output folder.
2. Do not create or delete outside workspace unless explicitly requested.
3. Never `npm install` in deliverable workspace folders.

## 6. API exposure

1. If the task is exposed through API, route actions through `scripts/` checks and deterministic files.
2. Treat this file as source of truth for managed runtime constraints.
