# Research Synthesis

Use this skill for substantial research where the answer must be grounded in
real files, logs, sources, or current external evidence. Do not use it for
simple factual lookup, one-source Q&A, or ordinary code changes.

## Hard Rules

- Inspect the real provided files, logs, repo paths, or source artifacts before
  explaining behavior or generating conclusions.
- Save every research artifact under `{workspace}/research/`; create the
  directory before writing.
- Never save research artifacts directly in `{workspace}/`.
- Avoid CLI-specific assumptions. Use only tools actually available in the
  current host runtime.
- Use native subagents only when the user explicitly asks for multi-agent,
  parallel-agent, or delegation work, or when the host runtime has
  clearly authorized subagent use for the task.
- When subagents are authorized, use multiple subagents for independent facets
  or dimensions instead of defaulting to a single delegated worker.
- If subagents are not authorized or unavailable, run the same workflow locally
  in sequential rounds with a smaller but explicit evidence budget.
- For file-only requests, do not perform external search.
- For current or time-sensitive claims, check the current date/time before
  analysis and make search windows explicit.
- Match the user's search language unless the task requires a specific locale.
- Use standard Markdown footnotes in research artifacts: `[^id]` inline plus
  `[^id]: Title. Date. URL` definitions.

## Start

1. Resolve `{workspace}` to the current working directory.
2. Resolve `{skill_dir}` to the active installed directory containing this
   `SKILL.md`. Do not assume the current working directory is the skill
   directory.
3. Create `{workspace}/research/`.
4. Pick a stable topic slug:
   - Prefer short ASCII, lowercase, hyphenated words.
   - If the topic is mostly non-ASCII or ambiguous, use
     `research-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.
5. State the selected route and one-sentence rationale before researching.
6. Follow the route details in [routes.md](references/routes.md).

## Routing

| Signal | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Files plus "only based on files", "no search", or equivalent | C: File-only |
| Files plus "refer to", "combine with", or no explicit restriction | D: File-augmented |
| No files plus broad landscape question | A: Wide search |
| No files plus specific bounded question | B: Focused search |

When unclear, prefer Route D over Route C for file tasks, and Route A over
Route B for broad multi-faceted topics. If that would conflict with an explicit
user constraint, honor the constraint.

## Subagent Policy

This skill supports multi-agent research but does not require it.

When subagents are authorized:

- Dispatch multiple bounded, independent research tasks using the host's native
  subagent tool. Prefer one subagent per facet, dimension, or validation
  conflict when those tasks can write separate artifacts.
- Default to up to 8 concurrent subagents per round unless the host states a
  different limit. For larger decompositions, launch additional bounded rounds.
- Give each agent the mission, context, allowed/disallowed sources, exact output
  format, and exact output path.
- Do not assume subagents inherit main-agent context; pass paths or excerpts.
- Do not launch duplicate agents on the same question.
- Do not let two subagents write the same artifact path; merge or synthesize in
  the main agent after their outputs are complete.

When subagents are not authorized or unavailable:

- Execute dimensions sequentially in the main agent.
- Preserve the same artifact names and citation contract.
- Reduce search counts pragmatically and record the reduced budget in
  `{topic}_cross_verification.md`.

Use [prompts.md](references/prompts.md) for subagent/local-round templates.

## Required Outputs

All files live under `{workspace}/research/`.

| File | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{topic}_file_analysis.md` | C, D | File inventory, extraction, cross-file mapping |
| `{topic}_wideNN.md` | A | Wide exploration facets |
| `{topic}_dimNN.md` | A, B, C, D | Dimension-specific evidence |
| `{topic}_validationNN.md` | Optional | Conflict-specific validation output before merge |
| `{topic}_cross_verification.md` | A, B, C, D | Confidence tiers and conflict zones |
| `{topic}_insight.md` | A, B, C, D | Cross-dimension insights |
| `{topic}_final.md` | Optional | Final Markdown report when no writing skill is available |

Before final handoff, run:

```bash
RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR="${BOX_AGENT_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR:-${RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR:-{skill_dir}}}"
if [ ! -f "$RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate_research_artifacts.py" ] && [ -f "$HOME/.box-agent/skills/research-synthesis/scripts/validate_research_artifacts.py" ]; then
  RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR="$HOME/.box-agent/skills/research-synthesis"
fi
if [ ! -f "$RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate_research_artifacts.py" ] && [ -f "$HOME/.box-agent/skills/deep-research-swarm-officev3/scripts/validate_research_artifacts.py" ]; then
  RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR="$HOME/.box-agent/skills/deep-research-swarm-officev3"
fi
if [ ! -f "$RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate_research_artifacts.py" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: validate_research_artifacts.py not found under $RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR/scripts" >&2
  exit 1
fi
${BOX_AGENT_PYTHON:-python3} "$RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate_research_artifacts.py" --research-dir "{workspace}/research" --topic "{topic}" --route A
```

Adjust `--route` for the selected route. Add `--min-dimensions N` when the
dimension count differs from the default.

## Final Handoff

If a report-writing, paper-writing, document, or presentation skill is available
and the user requested that output type, hand off explicit file paths and state
that research is complete. Otherwise, produce `{topic}_final.md` from the
verified research artifacts.

For technical product or codebase research tasks:

- Preserve product/runtime ownership boundaries in the synthesis when relevant.
- Distinguish UI assumptions from runtime evidence.
- Call out whether a finding is source-tree evidence, runtime-bundled evidence,
  log evidence, user-file evidence, or external-source evidence.
- Keep recommendations narrow and reversible unless the user asked for broader
  strategy.
