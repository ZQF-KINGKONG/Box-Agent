# Output Contract

## Directory

All outputs must be under:

```text
{workspace}/research/
```

## Citation Format

Use Markdown footnotes:

```markdown
This claim has evidence.[^stable-id]

[^stable-id]: Source title. Publication date. https://example.com
```

For file-only evidence:

```markdown
The source file says this.[^file-a-p3]

[^file-a-p3]: File: strategy.pdf, page 3, section "Market risks".
```

Rules:

- Reuse the same id for the same URL or file section.
- Every inline marker must have a definition.
- Every definition should map to one source.
- Keep verbatim excerpts short.
- Preserve source dates; if no date exists, write `N.D.`.

## Required Artifact Shapes

### File Analysis

```markdown
# [Topic] File Analysis

Route: C or D
Time Check: [timestamp]
Constraints: [file-only or file-augmented]

## File Inventory
| File | Type | Size | Summary |

## Per-File Extraction

## Cross-File Mapping

## Gaps

## Consolidated Themes
```

### Cross-Verification

```markdown
# [Topic] Cross-Verification

Route: [A/B/C/D]
Evidence Budget: [actual searches/files/dimensions]

## High Confidence

## Medium Confidence

## Low Confidence

## Conflict Zones

## Validation Updates
```

### Targeted Validation

Optional per-conflict output before the main agent merges updates into
`{topic}_cross_verification.md`.

```markdown
# [Topic] Validation [NN]

Conflict: [short conflict statement]
Evidence Checked: [sources/files searched or inspected]
Resolution: [resolved / narrowed / unresolved]
Confidence: [high / medium / low]
Merge Notes: [exact update recommended for cross-verification]
```

### Final Markdown

Use when no downstream writing skill is available:

```markdown
# [Topic]

## Executive Summary

## Verified Findings

## Conflict Zones

## Derived Insights

## Method and Evidence Limits

## Sources
```
