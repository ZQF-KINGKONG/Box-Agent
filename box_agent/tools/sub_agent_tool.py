"""Sub-agent tool for isolated context execution.

Spawns a child agent loop with its own message history so that
intermediate tool output (file reads, exploratory analysis, etc.)
stays out of the parent context.  Only the final summary is returned.

Multiple sub-agent calls are ``parallel_safe`` and will be executed
concurrently via ``asyncio.gather`` in the core loop.
